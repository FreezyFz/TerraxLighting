# TerraxLighting
A plugin for RPGMaker MV: Creates an extra layer that darkens a map and adds lightsources!

Support and questions can be asked on this forum: 
http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/49339-terrax-lighting-system/

The plugin (complete with demo) can also be downloaded here,
http://mvplugins.com/plugin/Terrax/Terrax Lighting System

Because the zip contains java-script files some overactive virus/mallware scanners give warnings,
thats why its also as plain text on github.

Terrax.
