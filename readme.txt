Terraxlighting.zip only contains the script.

Recenly RPGMaker has been updated with new graphics scripts (new version of pixi). This upgrade caused some errors that could
be corrected, but the updated terraxlighting script will no longer run with old RPG-Maker core scripts.
If you did not upgrade your game with the new RPG-Maker MV core scripts, you will have to use the plugin called 'Terraxlighting_pixi3.js' instead
There is no difference in the scripts other then some definitions.

Demo.zip contains a simple demo, just create a new project and overwrite the data and js directorys with the files in demo.zip

This zip contains java-script files, some virus and malware detectors might flag it as a possible danger.
If you don't trust it, you can also download it in plain text from

Terrax.
